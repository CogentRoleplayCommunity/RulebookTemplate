# Running the Game

In this chapter, we will provide a selection of tools for Narrators. These are not rules a Narrator must follow, but rather a toolbox to pull from to help run encounters in Cogent Roleplay. Narrators are encouraged to use whatever methods best suit their game. 

## Story Structure

Cogent Roleplay is a narrative game. Because of this, it can be helpful to envision a campaign as following a story structure similar to that of a book series, TV show, or play. Dividing your game's story into segments like this can help you better envision how to pace a narrative and handle character progression.

**We recommend equating roleplay sessions to a story structure as follows:**

* **Campaign:**  A campaign represents the entirety of your tabletop roleplaying game, from the start of session one through your adventures across multiple story arcs.  Campaigns represent a piece of the narrative similar to an entire book series or all seasons of a TV show. Campaigns typically take years to complete.
* **Story:** Campaigns are broken into Stories. A Story represents a narrative arc with a complete beginning, middle, and end. Just like a book can be a standalone tale or have several sequels, Campaigns could contain a single story, or thread multiple Stories together to tell a grand overarching narrative. Stories represent a piece of the narrative similar to a single book in a series or one season of a TV show. Stories can take anywhere between a month to a year to complete.
* **Act:** Stories can be thought of as smaller Chapters grouped into Acts. Acts represent a piece of the narrative similar to acts in a play. For longer Stories, breaking them into smaller Acts can help better plan one piece at a time. However, some shorter Stories may only equate to the length of a single Act. 
* **Chapter:** Stories are broken into Chapters. Chapters typically encompass one small piece of the overall narrative, one quest, battle, or other conflict to resolve. Chapters represent a piece of the narrative similar to a chapter in a book, or an episode of a TV show. Chapters typically take 1-3 game sessions to complete.
* **Scene:** Chapters are broken into Scenes. Scenes represent each single, small interaction making up a Chapter.  Typically, you will have one major Dice Roll per Scene. Scenes represent a piece of the narrative similar to a scene in a TV show or play. Scenes typically take minutes to complete. 



## Narration

The role of the Narrator is to facilitate the campaign's storytelling.  You are there to ensure each Player's Character has the opportunity to play their part in the grand narrative. You guide the team to collaborate in creating a story together.  

The following section details the basics you will need for successful Narration.  Later sections will cover ways to use what you've learned to build a complete Campaign.

<!-- Narrator Tools -->
### Actions

An Action is a task initiated by a Player that will likely result in having to make a Dice Roll.  

**The following rules apply to Actions:**

* If the Dice Pool for a Dice Roll is greater than the CL for the Action, the Character will successfully complete the task they were attempting.
  * Narrative Failure does not make an Action unsuccessful, just costly, complicated, or with unforeseen consequences.
* A Narrator must tell the Player if the Action is impossible (if the Dice Pool is equal to or smaller than the CL).
* All Actions must be declared before a Dice Roll is performed.
* Once declared, an Action can not be changed.  The Character will attempt the Action (even if impossible).

### Initiative

Initiative is used to allow one Character to target another Character's Actions. Unlike other TTRPGs, Cogent Roleplay uses a reverse-order Initiative.  This is because Characters can not change Actions after they are declared. However, a Character may target another's declared Action as part of their own Action.  

#### Detemining Initiative 

There are four ways to determine a Character's Initiative score. 

1. **Attritional Initiative:** Uses STR score as Initiative. Used if the Character is attempting to endure the challenges they are facing, or relying on muscle memory to drive their Actions. 
2. **Reactive Initiative:** Uses RFL score as Initiative. Used if the Character is relying heavily on their senses to react to threats and drive their Actions.
3. **Tactical Initiative:** Uses INT score as Initiative. Used if the Character is analyzing the situation and devising strategies to counter their opponents.
4. **Manipulative Initiative:**  * Uses CHA score as Initiative. Used if the Character is attempting to control the emotional state of their opponents so they can better gain an advantage in the situation.

#### Running Initiative

When using Initiative, encounters can be played out using the steps outlined below. 

1. Determine each Character's Initiative.
   * Not every Character will use the same type of Initiative.
   * The Initiative type may change throughout the encounter based on the Character's Actions.
2. Starting with the Character with the smallest Initiative, have each Player declare their Action.
   * Characters with the same Initiative cannot target each others' Actions. 
   * If both Players and NPCs have a tied Initiative, have Players declare their Actions first, then follow up with the NPCs'.
3. Have each Character make their Dice Roll.
4. Gather the results and declare the outcome of the Initiative round.
5. Repeat until Initiative is no longer necessary.

### Narrative Success and Failure

Success and failure are determined by a Character's Dice Pool. An Action will always succeed if the related Dice Pool exceeds the CL for a Dice Roll. Dice Rolls are used to determine how strongly or poorly a Character performs. 

#### Narrative Success

Each Win above the CL is considered a Narrative Success.  The higher the Narrative Success, the greater the Character performs. Their incredible performance can be reflected mechanically.

**Here are some suggestions you can use:**

* Have the narrative stakes favor the Character by changing the attitude or emotion of their target, such as a powerful blow causing an enemy to fear the Character.
* Increase the CL to detect the effects of the Action, such as making it more difficult to see if an item was tampered with.
* Decrease the time needed to perform the Action, such as sprinting to a destination in half the expected time.
* ±1 Temporary Destiny Pool to a targeted Action (Player's choice).
* Decrease the CP cost for an item or service.
* +1 Injury Level per Narrative Success.

#### Narrative Failure

Each Win below the CL is considered a Narrative Failure. It is important to reiterate that while a Character's Action may automatically succeed, Narrative Failures can still cause costly consequences that harm their progress.  The higher the Narrative Failure, the greater the cost.  

**Here are some suggestions you can use:**

* Have the narrative stakes build tension for the Character by changing their attitude or emotion because of their Action, such as regretting the decision to provoke a powerful enemy by striking them. 
* Decrease the CL to detect the effects of the Action, such as making it obvious that an item was tampered with. 
* Increase the time needed to perform the Action, such as navigating to a difficult destination - but very, very late!
* ± Temporary Destiny Pool to a targeted Action (Narrator's choice). 
* Increase the CP cost for an item or service.
* * +1 Injury Level per Narrative Failure to you.


### Injury Levels and Healing

When a Character is hurt, they are given Injuries.  Injuries are broken into three elements: An Injury name, an Injury category, and an Injury Level.  

**Injuries are recorded using this format:**

[Name] [injury level] [penalty] *(ex. Deep slash, Lvl 3, -3D6)*

Injuries can be chosen using the table below,

| **Category** | **Injury Level** | **Penalty** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trivial | 0 | -0D6 | Scrapes |
| Trivial | 1 | -1D6 | Bruises |
| Wounded | 2 | -2D6 | Minor Injury |
| Wounded | 3 | -3D6 | Moderate Injury |
| Traumatic | 4 | -4D6 | Serious Injury |
| Traumatic | 5 | -5D6 | Dead |

When a Character is Injured, they must make [succeed or fail](#narrative-success-and-failure) an Endurance check. The CL for the check is equal to the total of all Injury Levels the Character has.  If they will automatically fail, they fall unconscious.

> Bob the boxer has endured 6 grueling rounds and has now been hit with a devastating uppercut.  
> Bob previously had 2 Level 1 injuries, 1 Level 2 injury, and now has received a Level 3 injury.  Bob has a total of 7 Injury Levels (1 + 1 + 2 + 3).
> Bob's Endurance Dice Pool is 7D6. 7D6 is not greater than the CL of 7, so Bob falls to the mat unconscious.

#### Injury Category

There are three unique Injury categories: **Trivial,** **Wounded,** and **Traumatic.**  An Injury is a Trivial Injury if the Injury Level is **0 or 1**, an Injury is a Wounded Injury if the Injury Level is **2 or 3**, and an injury is a Traumatic injury if the Injury Level is 4 or greater.

#### Healing

There are three unique types of healing: **Natural Healing, Medical Treatment,** and **Emergency Care.**  Regardless of type, the CL for a healing check is always **the total of all Injury Levels the patient has.**

**Natural Healing:** Natural Healing describes healing the body does on its own. Typically, once per Chapter, a Character may declare they are Naturally Healing.  The Character makes an Endurance skill check, with one of two outcomes:

* **Narrative Success:** A Trivial Injury has its Injury Level reduced by 1 per Narrative Success. The Injury is removed if at a level less than zero.
* **Narrative Failure:** A non-Trivial Injury has its Injury Level increased by +1 per Narrative Failure. The same Injury cannot be increased mroe than once.

**Medical Treatment:** Medical Treatment refers to healing involving professional medical equipment and care. Medical Treatment requires the use of a [Specialization](/Playing%20the%20Game.md#skills) and adequate medical supplies.  Typically, a Character can attempt to perform Medical Treatment on a patient once per Chapter. Medical Treatment reduces the Injury Level of the highest non-Traumatic Injury by 1. Narrative Success or Failure effects how long the Medical Treatment takes, with Narrative Failure increasing the number of days the Character needs treatment.  

**Emergency Care:** Unlike other methods of healing, Emergency Care can be used multiple times per Chapter on the same patient.  Each time a Character performs Emergency Care on a patient, they are making an Injury permanent. For instance, they may sacrifice a limb to save the body.  Narrative Success reduces the Injury Level before it becomes permanent, while Narrative Failure increases the Injury Level of the Injury. In the case of a Narrative Failure, the Character must attempt another round of Emergency Care, or lose the patient.  Due to the high risk of death, most Emergency Care is done as a [collaborative roll](/Playing%20the%20Game.md#assists-and-collaborations).

### Destiny Rolls

Oftentimes in TTRPGs, scenarios occur where several dice rolls and skill checks need to be made for effects occurring "off-screen".  To prevent having to roll more dice than absolutely necessary, Cogent introduces a mechanic called the **Destiny Roll**.<br/>

All **Destiny Rolls** are done with a single twenty-sided dice, or 1D20.  The CL for the **Destiny Roll** is based on the difficulty of combined tasks.

| **Difficulty (%)** | 5% | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25% | 30% | 35% | 40% | 45% | 50% | 55% | 60% | 65% | 70% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 90% | 95% | 100% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CL** | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

To generate a positive outcome, the **Destiny Roll** result must be equal to or greater than the CL for the roll.  **Destiny Rolls** are mostly used by **Narrators** when the actions of NPCs do not directly affect Player.  This greatly speeds up gameplay by allowing the story to continue without pausing for long stretches of dice rolls.

*To Give an Example:*

> King John's men are traveling through Sherwood Forest with the latest taxes.  They know that Robin Hood and his Merry Men are planning to ambush the convoy, but King John's men have devised several new paths through the forest.<br/>
> Instead of rolling multiple Perception and General Knowledge checks to avoid an ambush point, the Narrator decides to perform a **Destiny Roll** for the convoy. <br/>
> The Narrator determines there is roughly a 75% chance the convoy will hit an ambush point, giving them a 25% chance to avoid them. The Narrator sets the **CL** for the **Destiny Roll** at **16** (100% - 75% = 25%). The Narrator rolls a **13,** or **a Narrative Failure of -3**. <br/>
> The convoy rolls right into the ambush, but their agitated state means they are not fully caught unaware. <br/>

## Encounters

This section covers various methods you can use to run different scenes, or encounters, in your campaign. 

### Combat Encounters

Combat occurs in encounters involving violence between multiple Characters. Combat encounters can range anywhere from a sudden bar brawl to an elaborate tactical mission to ambush an enemy base. Combat makes use of the Initiative mechanic, as well as other components Narrators should consider.

#### Combat Range

Combat Ranges are not absolute distances, but rather estimations of different ranges where engaging in a fight will look differently. 

**The five Combat Ranges are as follows:**

* **Grapple:** When Characters are in direct physical contact with each other.
  * Unless stated otherwise, weapons designed to be used at Thrown, Ranged, or Artillery range can not be used in Grapple range.
* **Melee:** A small distance where Characters can easily hit each other with a couple of steps, such as Characters in the same room.
* **Thrown:** The distance from which a Character can throw a rock, spear, or dart effectively - roughly 50 yards/meters.  
* **Ranged:** The range from which a weapon such as a bow or firearm can be used where distinguishing features can still be made out - typically within 100 yards/meters.
   * At this range and beyond, Melee and Grapple weapons can not be used.
* **Artillery:** Any distance beyond Ranged is considered Artillery.  Weapons that are effective at this range typically use spotters (i.e. Assist Action), technology (i.e. scopes), or magic (i.e. scrying) in order to lock onto a target. 

#### Weapons and Armor

Weapon damage is calculated using a combination of three elements, a damage modifier, a damage type, and a weapon's primary range (as detailed above). 

A damage modifier consists of an Attribute score added to a number from 0-3. The three damage types are **bludgeoning, slashing,** and **piercing.**

Weapons damage is denoted using the following format:

[Attribute]+[damage modifier] [damage type] [primary range] *(ex. INT+2 Slashing Melee)*

Narrators may add additional damage types to their settings if desired.

Armor has two elements: Armor Points (AP), and the armor's damage type. Each unique piece of armor will give **1-5 AP**, and have a **damage type** (from the types detailed above) that the armor is most effective against blocking.

Armor is denoted using the following format:

[AP] [damage type] *(ex. 4AP Piercing)*

When a Character receives an Injury Level, they may choose **to spend AP to reduce the Injury Level** by that amount (i.e. spending 1AP to reduce the Injury Level by 1).  If **the armor's damage type matches that of the weapon** causing the Injury, any AP spent is instantly recovered.  Otherwise, AP spent is recovered at the beginning of a new scene in the roleplay. 

*Most settings will use Armor with a unique property that gives the wearer a penalty to their Dice Pools. This is used to represent the encumbrances of wearing armor.*

#### Combat Roll CLs

As a Narrator, you will need to assign the CL for all Dice Rolls based on what works best given the situation surrounding the Dice Roll.  The following is a guide to help in that process for CLs in Combat.  

* **Combat Range VS Primary Range:** Compare the range that applies to the distance of the target with the primary range of the weapon used by the Character making the Roll.  For each range difference, apply a +1CL penalty.
  * **+0 CL:** Combat Range matches Primary Range
  * **+1 CL:** Grapple to Melee, Melee to Grapple or Thrown, Thrown to Melee or Ranged, Ranged to Thrown or Artillery, or Artillery to Ranged
  * **+2 CL:** Grapple to Thrown, Melee to Ranged, Thrown to Grapple or Artillery, Ranged to Melee, or Artillery to Thrown
  * **+3 CL:** Grapple to Ranged, Melee to Artillery, Ranged to Grapple, or Artillery to Melee
  * **+4 CL:** Grapple to Artillery, or Artillery to Grapple
* **Combat Modifiers:** Different combat maneuvers, field conditions, or positions offer advantages or disadvantages.
  * **Attacking while Prone (laying down) (based on weapon's Primary Range):** Grapple (+2 CL), Melee (+1 CL), Ranged (-1 CL), Artillery (-2 CL)
  * **Attacking someone that is Prone (based on distance of target):** Grapple (-2 CL), Melee (-1 CL), Thrown (+1 CL), Ranged (+2 CL), Artillery (+3 CL)
  * **Attacking from a superior position (i.e. higher ground):**  -1 to -3 CL (Narrator's discretion).
  * **Weapon Traits:** Some weapons will have traits that provide a benefit or penalty to CLs.  Use the weapon trait rules as applicable.
* **Movement:** The faster your target moves, the harder it is to hit them.  Narrators should apply a modifier to the CL if the target is moving towards or away from the Character.
  * **Walking Speed:** +1 CL
  * **Running Speed:** +2 CL
  * **Dodging/Sprint Speed:** +3 CL

### Investigations

Investigations are encounters involving two groups of people trying to outwit each other. These usually involve scenarios where one group is trying to uncover the plans of another party while the other group tries to cover up their intentions as they aim to achieve their ultimate objective. Many Narrators may use Investigations in murder mysteries, political intrigue, or detective stories. An Investigation encounter involves two key groups; Investigators and Conspirators.

#### Investigators

The goal of Investigators is to gather the evidence necessary to discover the Conspirators' goal. They usually hope to use that evidence to either stop the Conspirators from achieving their objective or prove the Conspirators are guilty. For instance, a detective party may be trying to track a heist crew to prevent them from robbing the local bank.

#### Conspirators

The goal of Conspirators is to successfully execute their plan, and get away with it undetected. For instance, a heist crew may be trying to rob the local bank without detectives noticing them. 

### Etiquette

Similar to [Combat Encounters](#combat-encounters), Etiquette encounters have two or more opposed groups of Characters that are attempting to harm each other. However, in Etiquette encounters, the goal is not to physically harm your opponents but to marginalize and socially isolate them.

### Barter

A Barter encounter applies to situations where Characters attempt to buy or sell.  In most situations, buying and selling items follows the standard rules for **Commerce Points.** Using the table below, compare the **Item Value** (IV) of the product/service with the **Commerce Point**s (CP) of the Character to determine how each character's CP is affected.

| **IV-CP** | **Buying** | **Selling** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| >0 | n/a | +(IV-CP) CP |
| 0 | -2 CP | -0 CP |
| -1 | -1 CP | -0 CP |
| -2 | -0 CP | -0 CP |

*Example:*
> Kelly is buying a sword from a merchant.  Kelly has 4CP and the merchant has 2CP.  The sword has a cost of 3 IV.<br/>
> When Kelly (buying) purchases the sword from the merchant, the IV-CP is -1 (3-4), so Kelly's CP is reduced by 1.  Kelly now has 3CP.
> The merchant (selling) has an IV-CP of +1 (3-2) so the merchant's CP is increased by +(IV-CP)CP or +1.  The merchant now has 3CP.

### Chase/Dogfight

Chases and Dogfights are specialized versions of [Combat Encounters](#combat-encounters) where the distance between the two opponents.
